1. Clone this repository*
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Write a test that will:
   1. Visit [carVertical](https://www.carvertical.com)
   2. In the VIN form, submit `SALLAAA146A396339` VIN
   3. Once precheck has loaded, pick 3-report package
   4. On the checkout page, apply `qahomework` voucher
   5. **Validate that the total price is shown correctly**
4. Share a link to the repository where we can review the test

\* This repo is set up to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), but you can use any framework you like as long as it uses TypeScript or JavaScript.
